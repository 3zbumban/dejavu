some of these 808s are literally the exact samples that the producers used
in the actual songs. These 808s are:

Plug walk 808 (The "permanent 808" from the Nick Mira Magma drum kit)
Lean wit me 808 (The "love" 808 from the Nick Mira Magma drum kit)
Lucid dreams 808 (The "freeman 808" from the DT hitz stigma drum kit)

Other than those 3 sounds, all of these sounds are original and
processed by me :)
